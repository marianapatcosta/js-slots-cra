- Follows the general rules of slot games, i.e, it aims to make the symbols spin and then check if you have combinations of 3 or more equal symbols displayed at one of the 9 possible winning lines;
- Different win factor according to symbol frequency and number of symbol matches (from 3 to 5);
- Customizable bet amount;

## Technical Stack

- **TypeScript**;
- **React** (use of functional components and hooks, portal, context, custom hooks);
- **Redux** (including persistence middleware to store state at localStorage);
- **Webpack /CRA**;
- **SCSS modules** with BEM methodology;
- **typed-scss-modules** (to generate TypeScript definitions for SCSS modules);
- **HTML Canvas** (for drawing Pay Lines);
- **react-i18next** for internationalization;
- **CSS animations** (for symbol SVGs and fake loader);
- **Jest** and **React Testing library** (for some unit tests with test coverage);
- **react-transition-group** (for modal/toast transitions);
- **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)** (for spin animation);
- Basic ESlint and Prettier configs;
- **GitHub actions**

- Cypress (basic setup only);

### What I've used but had to let go

#### Vite ([repo](https://github.com/marianapatcosta/js-slots-vite) and [deploy](https://marianapatcosta.github.io/js-slots-vite/) )

- Error on running unit tests due to a supposed error with _react-i18n_ and _vite-plugin-pwa_ mocks;
- Tool to generate type definitions for scss (_vite-plugin-sass-dts_) caused errors;
- Problems when registering web workers;

## Issues
### Spin animation is buggy (after stop spinning, there is a 'jump' to show the win screen)
#### Attempts:
- no tool animation;
- GSAP animation of all symbols, of reel as a whole, both depending on isSpinning redux state; 
- Add the final slot screen symbols at the end of spinning;
- Prepare the shuffled reels with final slot screen symbols before spinning (but reels do not stay at proper position, showing the wrong symbols for final slot screen);
- DOM manipulation with ids and determining the visible reels by assessing top css property (ugly code);
- useImperativeHandle hook to execute reel animation from parent component and overcome the state update issue was not working;

### CRA 
- no support for path alias (add *craco* to overcome this issue);
- Cypress configuration needs several additional packages and I could not run the first test I wrote  because `cypress/webpack-preprocessor` (needed e.g. to load scss files) is incompatible with React v18.1.
